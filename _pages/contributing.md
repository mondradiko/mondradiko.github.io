When writing source code for Mondradiko, please follow the
[Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html),
with a couple exceptions:

- For convenience's sake, please use #pragma once over include guards.
- Forward declarations are preferred whenever possible, to decrease compilation time.

GitHub will automatically check your formatting when you make a pull request.

Before making any major changes, please raise an issue to discuss the planned
changes with the maintainers. When making a pull request, we may ask that you
make some changes to integrate better with the source, or to fix
formatting/style choices. GitHub is set up to test the formatting and build
status of any PRs, so it will let you know if/where your code needs to be
fixed.

The best way to keep in touch with Mondradiko's development is to join
[our Discord server](https://discord.gg/NENngxc).
