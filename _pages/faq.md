# Where does the name "Mondradiko" come from?

"Mondradiko" is [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto)
for "world root." The original candidate for the
name was "world seed," which translates to
"Mondraspermo," but that doesn't have the 
same charm to it.

# How is "Mondradiko" pronounced?

Mahn-drah-dee-koh.

# Why open source?

Virtual reality might be connected directly to your brain
one day. When that day comes, would you really want to
be running proprietary software on your headset? Seeing
how the VR community is responding to Facebook's
stranglehold on the Oculus Quest 2 and its mandatory
Facebook login, I think not. The development of
open source VR, both hardware and software, is essential
to making VR safe and private for everyone.

# Will Mondradiko be on PlayStation VR?

No, because Sony's PlayStation SDK is proprietary
and requires the signing of a non-disclosure agreement
to be used, meaning it's incompatible with Mondradiko's
open source license.

If you'd like to use a PSVR headset with Mondradiko
or PC VR in general, consider using
[Monado](https://monado.dev), an open source OpenXR
runtime that supports the PlayStation VR headset.
